## LOGIN REGISTER APP
This is my practice project where I have tried to implement
- Authorisation on login and Sign up using Passport
- To reduce spam registrations authentication is made by two ways
  - By sending a verification link to user email
  - By admin approval
- Admin can 
  - Accept the signup request and authenticate the profile of user
  - Decline the request if admin is not conviced with the authenticity of user
- User Dashboard is provided where he can 
  - Edit Credentials
  - Delete his Account
- Everyone cannot register as Admin , for registering as Admin you have to provide your email ID to the developer(Deeksha Sharma).
- Implemented using Node.js as Library and Express.js as a framework
